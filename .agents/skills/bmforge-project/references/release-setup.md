**For greenfield Codex bootstrap projects, these files are already generated:** `scripts/new-release.sh`, the CMDB checker, version constants, `CHANGELOG.md` and disabled deployment lifecycle wrappers. Don't copy them again. Bootstrap never commits or publishes a release. The mandatory [Installation Lifecycle skill]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/component-installation.md %}) requires the application developer to finish and test install, upgrade and uninstall, including a successful installed-version marker, before treating the app as release-ready. Merely having executable shell scripts does not establish readiness.

For manually created projects, prepare the tooling once. Use [Creating a Release]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/creating-a-release.md %}) for subsequent releases.

## Prepare the Constants and Changelog

Complete [CMDB Compliance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/cmdb-compliance.md %}) first. Establish the canonical application name, constants path, literal `VERSION`, and initial `CMDB_CODENAME`. Declare persistent components, database references, and network listeners, using empty tuples where none exist. For listener applications, complete [Network Configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/network-configuration.md %}) so runtime defaults and lifecycle checks consume the declaration.

Add the three lifecycle entry points using [Installation Scripts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/installation-scripts.md %}). They must be executable and committed before releasing; deployment remains a separate operation.

Create `CHANGELOG.md` with exactly one `## [Unreleased]` heading. The [changelog template]({{ '/templates/project/CHANGELOG.md' | relative_url }}) provides the initial structure. Follow [Changelog Maintenance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/changelog-maintenance.md %}) **for every completed change**, not just release preparation. Add or refresh `### Summary` for meaningful work from the first change onward.

## Install the Scripts

For manual projects without the Codex bootstrap, copy these files from BMForge:

| BMForge source | Project destination |
| --- | --- |
| [Release script]({{ '/templates/project/scripts/new-release.sh' | relative_url }}) | `scripts/new-release.sh` |
| [Metadata checker]({{ '/templates/project/scripts/check-cmdb.py' | relative_url }}) | `scripts/check-cmdb.py` |

Make `scripts/new-release.sh` executable. It requires Bash, Git, Python 3.10 or newer, and standard GNU command-line tools. Projects with a static PEP 621 `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml` get version synchronization automatically; that version must initially match the literal application `VERSION`. It reads and edits metadata without importing application code.

Replace `__PROJECT_NAME__` and `__PROJECT_SLUG__` in the script's settings block with the canonical application name and its lowercase form. Review the version path, changelog path, remote, and branch names. The standard defaults are `origin`, `dev`, `main`, and `feat/maint-`.

Deployment impact tracking is configured separately. Leave `dependency_rules` and `deployment_config` empty until [Deployment Impact Tracking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/deployment-impact-tracking.md %}) is ready; enable both together when using it.

## Establish the Branches

For projects initialized through the **Codex bootstrap**, the project-local
manager handles the initial *local* release branching after a user-reviewed
commit on `main`:

```sh
python3 .agents/bmforge/manage.py setup-branches --project . --dry-run
python3 .agents/bmforge/manage.py setup-branches --project .
```

The first command checks prerequisites without changing refs. The second
creates `dev` and `feat/maint-0.1.0`, both based on the initial `main`
commit, and switches to the feature branch. It does **not** commit, publish
a branch to `origin`, configure a remote or create a release. Explicitly
review and commit the generated scaffold first. Do not re-create or overwrite
existing branches: reconcile existing `dev`/feature remote refs separately.

For projects that were **not** initialized through the Codex bootstrap, use
the original manual commands below.


Start with a committed initial project on `main` and an `origin` remote. Create the development and first feature branches:

```sh
git switch main
git switch -c dev
git switch -c feat/maint-0.1.0
```

Use an existing `dev` branch when one is already present. Feature work branches from `dev`. Before each release, `main` must be an ancestor of `dev`, and `dev` an ancestor of the feature branch. Local `main` and `dev` must contain their remote counterparts. The script can create missing remote branches during its release push.

## Verify the Setup

- Run the metadata checker with the actual project name and constants path.
- Run `bash -n scripts/new-release.sh` and `scripts/new-release.sh --help`.
- Commit the scripts, constants, changelog, and any configured deployment metadata before releasing.
- Exercise an adapted release script in a disposable repository with a local bare remote. Verify matching version, codename, changelog, branch tips, and annotated tag.
