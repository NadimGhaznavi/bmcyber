# DevLog implementation

One systemd process runs the standard-library HTTP display server on
`0.0.0.0:19700` and a socket-owning ZMQ REQ/REP thread on
`tcp://0.0.0.0:19701`. MariaDB runs as its own existing database daemon.

                                                     |
                                                interface/DbMgr --> MariaDB

HTTP report --> activity/Report ----------------------+
```

The CLI runs Git and release scripts on the local machine. `LocalRepository`
resolves the checkout and its GitHub identity. `CommitTask` checks that a task
exists before staging changes, coordinates the commit, and records completion
before pushing. `dl publish` invokes the repository's existing release script;
it is unrelated to the Git component's managed-file publication operation.
No release automation is invented or run by installation.

Domain SQL and atomic transitions belong to `interface/TaskDb.py`. A singleton
database row serializes mutations. Unique generated columns enforce one open
interval globally and one unfinished task per repository. Database transactions
roll back all changes if switching repositories fails. Every worker owns its
database connection; there is no shared connection or ORM.

`DbMgr.py` and `Localizer.py` are unchanged copies of their pinned canonical
templates. DevLog adapts the Git template with an `on_committed` callback between
the local commit and push to implement the user's explicitly agreed completion
boundary. The prescribed Git commands, module inventory, and managed-file
publication implementation are retained. No automatic pull or push retry is added.

Stable identifiers and configuration defaults live in domain-grouped constants.
English is the source message catalogue; the unchanged localizer supports future
supplied translations. Human UI labels and CLI application messages use stable
`DText` keys. Wire fields, statuses, Git output, and service logs stay untranslated.

The report uses Jinja2 autoescaping and browser-side Plotly.js **4.1.1** from the
exact approved CDN URL. An HTML daily-hours table remains available if that asset
cannot load. No frontend build, Python plotting package, maps, or graph library is
introduced.

Pinned skill versions and source hashes are recorded in `.agents/bmforge/lock.json`.
There are no BMForge or reference-application imports at runtime.

Deployment is split between `scripts/install.sh -server HOST` for client-only
machines and `scripts/install-server.sh` for the server machine. Only the server
installer provisions MariaDB and systemd. The Python package's base dependency
is PyZMQ; the `server` extra adds Jinja2 and PyMySQL. Both installations provide
the public `bin/dl` path, and the server also provides `bin/dl-server` and
`bin/dl-db-init`. `conf/installation.json` records the role so `scripts/upgrade.sh`
can preserve it without upgrading a client into a server.
